# Factor_and_Multiple_Finder
This is an app which helps you find factors and multiples of different numbers. If you are a C++ developer like me, I give you a challenge - find the number in the program code which will execute something special.If you can find it tell me what it is and I will tell you if it is correct or not. 👍👍👍
